    <div id="description">
The fundamental frequency is generated based on the current date<br>
The bpm is based on the current hour<br>
The root of the chord is changed every 15 seconds<br>
A main harmony note is determined every minute and based on the current second and millisecond, each beat triggers a different multiple
of the fundamental and harmony note<br>
