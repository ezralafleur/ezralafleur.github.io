title: Turning Sketches into Stickers
published: true

## Prologue

Last week, a friend of mine sent me sketches so I could turn them into vinyl cut stickers. While it is fairly easy to turn clean scans into stickers (e.g. Import Bitmap into Roland CutStudio, Trace Outline, Cut), these were dark cellphone pictures that evaded any attempt of cleanly tracing the outlines let alone in a design that would be suitable for stickers. However, after some fiddling, I was able to create enough contrast in the image to get a workable trace in InkScape. I edited this new vector file to my liking and then had a sharp image to send to CutStudio for outlining and cutting.

## Steps

The images I received were as seen below.
